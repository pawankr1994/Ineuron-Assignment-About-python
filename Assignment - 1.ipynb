Those arithmetic expressions                         are evaluated first, and then compared as per relational operator and produce                         a boolean output in the end.

For example, (10 == 9) is a condition if 10 is                      equal to 9. As we know it is not correct, so it will return False. Studying                          logical expressions, we also come across some logical operators which can be                          seen in logical expressions most often.
