    "Flexibility: With logging, you have more control over where and how messages are displayed.

This gives you much more flexibility in how you manage and analyze log messages.\n",

    "The Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons are common debugging tools found in most modern integrated development environments (IDEs). Here are the differences between them:\n",

    "Step Over: This button tells the debugger to execute the current line of code and then move to the next line of code. If the current line of code contains a function call, the function is executed, but the debugger does not step into the function. This is useful for quickly stepping through a block of code without getting bogged down in the details of function calls.\n",

If the current line of code contains a function call, the debugger will move into the function and begin executing the code inside the function. This is useful for debugging a function or a block of code in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Out: This button tells the debugger to step out of the current function and return to the calling function. If the current line of code is inside a function, the debugger will continue executing the code in the function until it reaches the end of the function, and then return to the calling function. This is useful for quickly getting back to the higher-level code and continuing the debugging process from there."

    "A breakpoint is a designated point in the code where a debugger will pause the execution of a program to allow a developer to inspect its state. It is a debugging tool that allows developers to examine a program's execution at a specific point in time and to analyze the program's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "A breakpoint can be set on a specific line of code, on a function call, or on an event trigger. Once the breakpoint is set, the debugger will pause the program execution when it reaches that line of code or event, allowing the developer to inspect the program's state, including the values of variables and data structures, the call stack, and other relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breakpoints are essential for debugging complex programs, as they allow developers to isolate and analyze specific sections of code, find errors, and test the program's behavior under different conditions. By setting breakpoints, developers can also step through the code line by line, making it easier to understand how the program works and identify any issues that may arise."
